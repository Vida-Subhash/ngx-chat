## Documentation
Below you will find some instructions to getting started. [Have a look at the wiki for FAQ's and the API documentation.](https://github.com/pazznetwork/ngx-chat/wiki)

## Installation and usage

This instructions require Angular 10.

First of all, install ngx-chat and its dependencies via npm:
```bash
npm install --save @pazznetwork/ngx-chat @xmpp/client@~0.9.2 @angular/cdk@~10.0.0
```

After that, import ngx-chat in your root module:
```
@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [
        ...
        NgxChatModule.forRoot(),
        BrowserAnimationsModule, // alternatively NoopAnimationsModule 
    ],
    ...
})
```

Add the `ngx-chat`-component at the end of your root component template:
```html
<ngx-chat></ngx-chat>
``` 

You are now ready to go. You will not see anything until you log in.
Log in via `ngx-chat` wherever you want (e.g. in a component or a service)
 by injecting `ChatService` and calling `login`:
```
constructor(@Inject(ChatServiceToken) chatService: ChatService) {
    chatService.logIn({
        domain: 'ngx-chat.example',
        service: 'wss://ngx-chat.example:5280/websocket',
        password: 'password',
        username: 'someuser',
    });
}
```

Add the following to polyfills.ts:
```
/***************************************************************************************************
 * APPLICATION IMPORTS
 */
(window as any).global = window;
```

*Optional*: body padding when roster list is expanded

Add css styling like the following to your main styles.css if 
you want to resize your main content when the roster is expanded.
```css
body {
    transition-property: padding-right;
    transition-duration: 0.4s;
    padding-right: 0px;
}

body.has-roster {
    padding-right: 14em;
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**
A: It is tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

**Q: Does ngx-chat work with self signed certificates?**
A: Yes, if the following criteria are met:
* the certificate has to be trusted by the browser you are using. Chrome uses the operating system trust store for certificates while Firefox has a custom implementation.
* the common name (CN) matches the uri of the service you are connecting to 

**Q: Can ngx-chat be used without the UI?**
A: Yes. Inject the chat service via `@Inject(ChatServiceToken) public chatService: ChatService`, login via `logIn` and start sending messages via the `sendMessage` method.

**Q: My question is not answered**
A: [No problem, feel free to raise an issue](https://github.com/pazznetwork/ngx-chat/issues/new).
